# Diabetes Prediction using Support Vector Machine

This project is a simple binary classification model to predict whether a person is diabetic or not based on medical diagnostic data. It uses Support Vector Machine (SVM), a powerful supervised machine learning algorithm, to train and test the model on labeled data.

## Dataset

- Source: PIMA Indians Diabetes Dataset  
- Features: Medical measurements such as glucose level, blood pressure, insulin, BMI, age, etc.  
- Target:  
  - `0` for Non-Diabetic  
  - `1` for Diabetic  

---

## Model Used

- Algorithm: Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- Purpose: Binary classification (Diabetic vs Non-Diabetic)  
- Libraries: `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, `numpy`

## Performance

| Metric             | Score   |
|---------------------|---------|
| Training Accuracy   | 78.66%  |
| Testing Accuracy    | 77.27%  |

## Run the Script

- Open `diabetes_svm.py` in your IDE or run in terminal  
- Input medical feature values to get prediction output  
- Output:  
  - `The person is diabetic`  
  - `The person is not diabetic`
